# WORDLE Java Project

## Project Overview

During my Bachelor's degree, I developed a WORDLE-inspired game using Java, implementing a robust Client-Server architecture combined with a thread pool to handle multiple concurrent users. This project not only reinforced my programming skills but also deepened my understanding of networked applications and concurrency in Java.

## Key Features

- **Client-Server Architecture**: The application is structured with a server that manages game logic and multiple clients that interact with it, allowing for real-time gameplay.
- **Thread Pool Management**: Implemented a thread pool to efficiently manage multiple client connections, ensuring smooth gameplay without significant delays or resource exhaustion.
- **Game Logic**: Developed the core game mechanics, including word validation, tracking attempts, and providing feedback on guesses.
